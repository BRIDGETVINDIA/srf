# Spherical Random Features - Review of (J. Pennington et al., 2015)

In this project Notebooks: 

## 1- Random fourier features for Gaussian/Laplacian Kernels (Rahimi and Recht, 2007)
   - RFF-I: Implementation of a Python Class that generates random features for Gaussian/Laplacian kernels.
   - RFF-II: MSE evaluation of kernel matrices on USPS and Gisette datasets.
   - RFF-III: SVM accuracy / computation time statistics on USPS/Gisette using Gaussian kernel. 
   
## 2 - Spherical Random Fourier for Polynomial kernels (J. Pennington et al., 2015)
   Implementation as two classes, one for approximating the sampling PDF and another to sample Fourier Features.
   - SRF-I: Implementation of the first class ApproxKernel
   - SRF-II: Implementation of the second one SRFF.
   - SRF-III: SVM/MSE on USPS and Gisette
   - SRF-stats: Reproduction of all J. Pennington et al. results, tables and figures
   
All python classes are stored in .py files for more convenience.
